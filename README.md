ITP Camp 2013: THREE.js workshop
================================

These are files used for a workshop I gave on THREE.js `blank.html` is a blank template and `finished.html` was what we were working towards. In order for the animation to run, pleaes view the file on a web server (this is due to some opaque security restrictions with THREE.js).
